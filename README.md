# Assignment for Lab 2
#### Biostatistics1 - Lab2



### 1. Read Chapters 3, 5, 12, 13 from “R for data science” (online version).

### 2. Create a GitHub repository Lab2 (ﬁles with R code for this assignment should be added to this repository, do not push csv ﬁles for Problem 4 to the GitHub repo).

### 3. Write the R code to recreate the graph from the Activity 2 (Problem 4).

### 4. Download two ﬁles:
    • coverage.csv - Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population (2013 - 2016)
    • expenditures.csv - Health Care Expenditures by State of Residence (in millions)

   #### 4.1 Make the data frames “tidy”.

   #### 4.2 Merge two data frames: the resulting data frame should contain information about coverage and expenditures for years 2013-2016. Please note that ﬁle expenditures.csv does not contain years 2015-2016.

### 5. Submit a link to the repo “Lab2” via Canvas.
